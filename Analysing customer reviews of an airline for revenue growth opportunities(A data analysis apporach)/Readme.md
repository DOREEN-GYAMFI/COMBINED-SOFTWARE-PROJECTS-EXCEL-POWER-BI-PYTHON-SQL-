 This was my  MSC project which I utilised American Airlines as a case study to employ NLP techniques,
 including sentiment analysis and topic modelling, in a year-on-year analysis of 23,300 online
 reviews from various sources. The aim is to pinpoint areas for improvement and strengths
 within the airline's customer feedback. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on
 specific timeframes, our approach provides a comprehensive view of passenger sentiments
 and concerns over time. By utilising web scraping for data collection and robust text
 preprocessing, ensures data quality. The multifaceted methodology involves exploratory data
 analysis, a hybrid sentiment analysis method using Vader lexicon updated with domain
 specific lexicon and Support Vector Machines, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic
 extraction, and topic sentiment.The findings reveal recurring patterns and emerging trends,
 offering insights into revenue growth opportunities and areas for improvement.Positive
 aspects are highlighted, such as in-flight experiences, while critical areas, such as flight
 delays, service consistency, and communication, are highlighted. To facilitate exploration and
 provide actionable recommendations by end users, interactive dashboards have been
 developed from findings. This study provides the airline with valuable insights that will help
 them improve their competitiveness, foster customer loyalty, and drive long-term revenue
 growth while increasing customer satisfaction.
